# WatchShop-Blazor-App
Welcome to the WatchShop Blazor app repository! This app is a proof of concept (POC) developed to learn and demonstrate the capabilities of Blazor for building web applications. The WatchShop app is designed to showcase a catalog of watches, allowing users to browse, search, and learn more about different watch models.
